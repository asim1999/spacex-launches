# space_x_launches

App to display Space X launch sites and their launches

If i had more time (>4 hrs) i would have done the following:
- Added a launch provider to facilitate local CRUD operations on top of the data
- Added ReorderableListViews to demonstrate reordering of items in a list
- Added forms to add a launchpad and add a launch for a specific launchpad
- Add animations for when a list is loaded
